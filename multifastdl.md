# Introduction #

This plugin is intended to distribute multiple fast download servers.

# Details #

When a client connects to the server, cvar sv\_downloadurl will be changed to one of the configured fastdl servers.

Just create the file **multifastdl.ini** in your **configs** directory and put one line for each fastdl url as you will put in sv\_downloadurl cvar.
